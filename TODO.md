## TODO

- SVG's for github stats and coding stats
- graphql triggers for grabbing events, repos, etc.
- add github stats to index
- about page?
- "recent posts" on the view post page?
- add support for "featured repository" or maybe "links" for posts
- adding tags to new post is still kinda broken
