# TODO

- contributor bubbles on repo/project banners
- SVG's for github stats and coding stats
- about page?
- "recent posts" on the view post page?
- add support for "featured repository" or maybe "links" for posts
- adding tags to new post is still kinda broken
- upgrade gorilla deps: <https://github.com/markbates/goth/issues/549>
