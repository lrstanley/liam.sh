Title: Saying Goodbye to Bouncer.ml

## It was fun while it lasted

I started Bouncer.ml quite a few years ago (at least 4 years now...). It
was quite a large project. I wanted to start with the automation of user
signup processes, and allow signups using the website. I definitely
accomplished that, with a peak of over 130 users on a single node.

Mid-may last year, I started collecting some statistics of connections,
clients, incoming/outgoing lines, and recieved/sent bytes through ZNC. Below
are a few snapshots of those stats. Although I didn't collect any during
Bouncer.ml's prime, I think these are still pretty awesome stats.

#### Client connections

#### Miscellaneous statistics

Note: the above screenshot are stats since the last ZNC reboot. about
21 weeks, for IRC... **YIKES**.

A bit older, but shows the average received lines.

And a few more screenshots to reminisce over:

### To sum up

In short, I'm glad that we had the chance to host so many IRC bouncer
accounts for folks, to give more attention to the still thriving IRC
protocol.

If you want to contact Allen, UclCommander, or I (the original admins of
bouncer.ml), you can always find us on https://byteirc.org/ in #/dev/null.
